Project Prompt:

Use Pytorch framework, build a program that solves a 5-class classification problem. 
The input would be a 5D vector. If the first element is the largest, categorize the output to class 1. If the second is the largest, categorize to class 2. etc. 

Use cross entropy as the loss function.
