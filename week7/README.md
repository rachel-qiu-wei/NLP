# NLP Project

## Overview
This project leverages a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze customer reviews and classify them based on sensitivity, specifically distinguishing between Positive and Negative sentiment.

## Models supportived
It supports a variety of neural network architectures and hybrid models for text classification, including:
- FastText
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Gated CNN (Gated Convolutional Neural Network)
- Stacked Gated CNN
- RCNN (Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network)
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- BERT + LSTM
- BERT + CNN
- BERT Mid-layer Extraction


## How to Run
### 1. Create a Virtual Environment


```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. run file
```bash
python main.py
```
